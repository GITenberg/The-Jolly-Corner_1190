<h1>THE JOLLY CORNER<br />
by Henry James</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Every one asks me what I &lsquo;think&rsquo; of everything,&rdquo;
said Spencer Brydon; &ldquo;and I make answer as I can&mdash;begging
or dodging the question, putting them off with any nonsense.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t matter to any of them really,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;for,
even were it possible to meet in that stand-and-deliver way so silly
a demand on so big a subject, my &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo; would still
be almost altogether about something that concerns only myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was talking to Miss Staverton, with whom for a couple of months now
he had availed himself of every possible occasion to talk; this disposition
and this resource, this comfort and support, as the situation in fact
presented itself, having promptly enough taken the first place in the
considerable array of rather unattenuated surprises attending his so
strangely belated return to America.&nbsp; Everything was somehow a
surprise; and that might be natural when one had so long and so consistently
neglected everything, taken pains to give surprises so much margin for
play.&nbsp; He had given them more than thirty years&mdash;thirty-three,
to be exact; and they now seemed to him to have organised their performance
quite on the scale of that licence.&nbsp; He had been twenty-three on
leaving New York&mdash;he was fifty-six to-day; unless indeed he were
to reckon as he had sometimes, since his repatriation, found himself
feeling; in which case he would have lived longer than is often allotted
to man.&nbsp; It would have taken a century, he repeatedly said to himself,
and said also to Alice Staverton, it would have taken a longer absence
and a more averted mind than those even of which he had been guilty,
to pile up the differences, the newnesses, the queernesses, above all
the bignesses, for the better or the worse, that at present assaulted
his vision wherever he looked.</p>
<p>The great fact all the while, however, had been the incalculability;
since he <i>had</i> supposed himself, from decade to decade, to be allowing,
and in the most liberal and intelligent manner, for brilliancy of change.&nbsp;
He actually saw that he had allowed for nothing; he missed what he would
have been sure of finding, he found what he would never have imagined.&nbsp;
Proportions and values were upside-down; the ugly things he had expected,
the ugly things of his far-away youth, when he had too promptly waked
up to a sense of the ugly&mdash;these uncanny phenomena placed him rather,
as it happened, under the charm; whereas the &ldquo;swagger&rdquo; things,
the modern, the monstrous, the famous things, those he had more particularly,
like thousands of ingenuous enquirers every year, come over to see,
were exactly his sources of dismay.&nbsp; They were as so many set traps
for displeasure, above all for reaction, of which his restless tread
was constantly pressing the spring.&nbsp; It was interesting, doubtless,
the whole show, but it would have been too disconcerting hadn&rsquo;t
a certain finer truth saved the situation.&nbsp; He had distinctly not,
in this steadier light, come over <i>all</i> for the monstrosities;
he had come, not only in the last analysis but quite on the face of
the act, under an impulse with which they had nothing to do.&nbsp; He
had come&mdash;putting the thing pompously&mdash;to look at his &ldquo;property,&rdquo;
which he had thus for a third of a century not been within four thousand
miles of; or, expressing it less sordidly, he had yielded to the humour
of seeing again his house on the jolly corner, as he usually, and quite
fondly, described it&mdash;the one in which he had first seen the light,
in which various members of his family had lived and had died, in which
the holidays of his overschooled boyhood had been passed and the few
social flowers of his chilled adolescence gathered, and which, alienated
then for so long a period, had, through the successive deaths of his
two brothers and the termination of old arrangements, come wholly into
his hands.&nbsp; He was the owner of another, not quite so &ldquo;good&rdquo;&mdash;the
jolly corner having been, from far back, superlatively extended and
consecrated; and the value of the pair represented his main capital,
with an income consisting, in these later years, of their respective
rents which (thanks precisely to their original excellent type) had
never been depressingly low.&nbsp; He could live in &ldquo;Europe,&rdquo;
as he had been in the habit of living, on the product of these flourishing
New York leases, and all the better since, that of the second structure,
the mere number in its long row, having within a twelvemonth fallen
in, renovation at a high advance had proved beautifully possible.</p>
<p>These were items of property indeed, but he had found himself since
his arrival distinguishing more than ever between them.&nbsp; The house
within the street, two bristling blocks westward, was already in course
of reconstruction as a tall mass of flats; he had acceded, some time
before, to overtures for this conversion&mdash;in which, now that it
was going forward, it had been not the least of his astonishments to
find himself able, on the spot, and though without a previous ounce
of such experience, to participate with a certain intelligence, almost
with a certain authority.&nbsp; He had lived his life with his back
so turned to such concerns and his face addressed to those of so different
an order that he scarce knew what to make of this lively stir, in a
compartment of his mind never yet penetrated, of a capacity for business
and a sense for construction.&nbsp; These virtues, so common all round
him now, had been dormant in his own organism&mdash;where it might be
said of them perhaps that they had slept the sleep of the just.&nbsp;
At present, in the splendid autumn weather&mdash;the autumn at least
was a pure boon in the terrible place&mdash;he loafed about his &ldquo;work&rdquo;
undeterred, secretly agitated; not in the least &ldquo;minding&rdquo;
that the whole proposition, as they said, was vulgar and sordid, and
ready to climb ladders, to walk the plank, to handle materials and look
wise about them, to ask questions, in fine, and challenge explanations
and really &ldquo;go into&rdquo; figures.</p>
<p>It amused, it verily quite charmed him; and, by the same stroke,
it amused, and even more, Alice Staverton, though perhaps charming her
perceptibly less.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t, however, going to be better-off
for it, as <i>he</i> was&mdash;and so astonishingly much: nothing was
now likely, he knew, ever to make her better-off than she found herself,
in the afternoon of life, as the delicately frugal possessor and tenant
of the small house in Irving Place to which she had subtly managed to
cling through her almost unbroken New York career.&nbsp; If he knew
the way to it now better than to any other address among the dreadful
multiplied numberings which seemed to him to reduce the whole place
to some vast ledger-page, overgrown, fantastic, of ruled and criss-crossed
lines and figures&mdash;if he had formed, for his consolation, that
habit, it was really not a little because of the charm of his having
encountered and recognised, in the vast wilderness of the wholesale,
breaking through the mere gross generalisation of wealth and force and
success, a small still scene where items and shades, all delicate things,
kept the sharpness of the notes of a high voice perfectly trained, and
where economy hung about like the scent of a garden.&nbsp; His old friend
lived with one maid and herself dusted her relics and trimmed her lamps
and polished her silver; she stood oft, in the awful modern crush, when
she could, but she sallied forth and did battle when the challenge was
really to &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; the spirit she after all confessed to,
proudly and a little shyly, as to that of the better time, that of <i>their</i>
common, their quite far-away and antediluvian social period and order.&nbsp;
She made use of the street-cars when need be, the terrible things that
people scrambled for as the panic-stricken at sea scramble for the boats;
she affronted, inscrutably, under stress, all the public concussions
and ordeals; and yet, with that slim mystifying grace of her appearance,
which defied you to say if she were a fair young woman who looked older
through trouble, or a fine smooth older one who looked young through
successful indifference with her precious reference, above all, to memories
and histories into which he could enter, she was as exquisite for him
as some pale pressed flower (a rarity to begin with), and, failing other
sweetnesses, she was a sufficient reward of his effort.&nbsp; They had
communities of knowledge, &ldquo;their&rdquo; knowledge (this discriminating
possessive was always on her lips) of presences of the other age, presences
all overlaid, in his case, by the experience of a man and the freedom
of a wanderer, overlaid by pleasure, by infidelity, by passages of life
that were strange and dim to her, just by &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; in short,
but still unobscured, still exposed and cherished, under that pious
visitation of the spirit from which she had never been diverted.</p>
<p>She had come with him one day to see how his &ldquo;apartment-house&rdquo;
was rising; he had helped her over gaps and explained to her plans,
and while they were there had happened to have, before her, a brief
but lively discussion with the man in charge, the representative of
the building firm that had undertaken his work.&nbsp; He had found himself
quite &ldquo;standing up&rdquo; to this personage over a failure on
the latter&rsquo;s part to observe some detail of one of their noted
conditions, and had so lucidly argued his case that, besides ever so
prettily flushing, at the time, for sympathy in his triumph, she had
afterwards said to him (though to a slightly greater effect of irony)
that he had clearly for too many years neglected a real gift.&nbsp;
If he had but stayed at home he would have anticipated the inventor
of the sky-scraper.&nbsp; If he had but stayed at home he would have
discovered his genius in time really to start some new variety of awful
architectural hare and run it till it burrowed in a gold mine.&nbsp;
He was to remember these words, while the weeks elapsed, for the small
silver ring they had sounded over the queerest and deepest of his own
lately most disguised and most muffled vibrations.</p>
<p>It had begun to be present to him after the first fortnight, it had
broken out with the oddest abruptness, this particular wanton wonderment:
it met him there&mdash;and this was the image under which he himself
judged the matter, or at least, not a little, thrilled and flushed with
it&mdash;very much as he might have been met by some strange figure,
some unexpected occupant, at a turn of one of the dim passages of an
empty house.&nbsp; The quaint analogy quite hauntingly remained with
him, when he didn&rsquo;t indeed rather improve it by a still intenser
form: that of his opening a door behind which he would have made sure
of finding nothing, a door into a room shuttered and void, and yet so
coming, with a great suppressed start, on some quite erect confronting
presence, something planted in the middle of the place and facing him
through the dusk.&nbsp; After that visit to the house in construction
he walked with his companion to see the other and always so much the
better one, which in the eastward direction formed one of the corners,&mdash;the
&ldquo;jolly&rdquo; one precisely, of the street now so generally dishonoured
and disfigured in its westward reaches, and of the comparatively conservative
Avenue.&nbsp; The Avenue still had pretensions, as Miss Staverton said,
to decency; the old people had mostly gone, the old names were unknown,
and here and there an old association seemed to stray, all vaguely,
like some very aged person, out too late, whom you might meet and feel
the impulse to watch or follow, in kindness, for safe restoration to
shelter.</p>
<p>They went in together, our friends; he admitted himself with his
key, as he kept no one there, he explained, preferring, for his reasons,
to leave the place empty, under a simple arrangement with a good woman
living in the neighbourhood and who came for a daily hour to open windows
and dust and sweep.&nbsp; Spencer Brydon had his reasons and was growingly
aware of them; they seemed to him better each time he was there, though
he didn&rsquo;t name them all to his companion, any more than he told
her as yet how often, how quite absurdly often, he himself came.&nbsp;
He only let her see for the present, while they walked through the great
blank rooms, that absolute vacancy reigned and that, from top to bottom,
there was nothing but Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s broomstick, in a corner,
to tempt the burglar.&nbsp; Mrs. Muldoon was then on the premises, and
she loquaciously attended the visitors, preceding them from room to
room and pushing back shutters and throwing up sashes&mdash;all to show
them, as she remarked, how little there was to see.&nbsp; There was
little indeed to see in the great gaunt shell where the main dispositions
and the general apportionment of space, the style of an age of ampler
allowances, had nevertheless for its master their honest pleading message,
affecting him as some good old servant&rsquo;s, some lifelong retainer&rsquo;s
appeal for a character, or even for a retiring-pension; yet it was also
a remark of Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s that, glad as she was to oblige him
by her noonday round, there was a request she greatly hoped he would
never make of her.&nbsp; If he should wish her for any reason to come
in after dark she would just tell him, if he &ldquo;plased,&rdquo; that
he must ask it of somebody else.</p>
<p>The fact that there was nothing to see didn&rsquo;t militate for
the worthy woman against what one <i>might</i> see, and she put it frankly
to Miss Staverton that no lady could be expected to like, could she?
&ldquo;craping up to thim top storeys in the ayvil hours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The gas and the electric light were off the house, and she fairly evoked
a gruesome vision of her march through the great grey rooms&mdash;so
many of them as there were too!&mdash;with her glimmering taper.&nbsp;
Miss Staverton met her honest glare with a smile and the profession
that she herself certainly would recoil from such an adventure.&nbsp;
Spencer Brydon meanwhile held his peace&mdash;for the moment; the question
of the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; hours in his old home had already become too
grave for him.&nbsp; He had begun some time since to &ldquo;crape,&rdquo;
and he knew just why a packet of candles addressed to that pursuit had
been stowed by his own hand, three weeks before, at the back of a drawer
of the fine old sideboard that occupied, as a &ldquo;fixture,&rdquo;
the deep recess in the dining-room.&nbsp; Just now he laughed at his
companions&mdash;quickly however changing the subject; for the reason
that, in the first place, his laugh struck him even at that moment as
starting the odd echo, the conscious human resonance (he scarce knew
how to qualify it) that sounds made while he was there alone sent back
to his ear or his fancy; and that, in the second, he imagined Alice
Staverton for the instant on the point of asking him, with a divination,
if he ever so prowled.&nbsp; There were divinations he was unprepared
for, and he had at all events averted enquiry by the time Mrs. Muldoon
had left them, passing on to other parts.</p>
<p>There was happily enough to say, on so consecrated a spot, that could
be said freely and fairly; so that a whole train of declarations was
precipitated by his friend&rsquo;s having herself broken out, after
a yearning look round: &ldquo;But I hope you don&rsquo;t mean they want
you to pull <i>this</i> to pieces!&rdquo;&nbsp; His answer came, promptly,
with his re-awakened wrath: it was of course exactly what they wanted,
and what they were &ldquo;at&rdquo; him for, daily, with the iteration
of people who couldn&rsquo;t for their life understand a man&rsquo;s
liability to decent feelings.&nbsp; He had found the place, just as
it stood and beyond what he could express, an interest and a joy.&nbsp;
There were values other than the beastly rent-values, and in short,
in short&mdash;!&nbsp; But it was thus Miss Staverton took him up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In short you&rsquo;re to make so good a thing of your sky-scraper
that, living in luxury on <i>those</i> ill-gotten gains, you can afford
for a while to be sentimental here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her smile had for him,
with the words, the particular mild irony with which he found half her
talk suffused; an irony without bitterness and that came, exactly, from
her having so much imagination&mdash;not, like the cheap sarcasms with
which one heard most people, about the world of &ldquo;society,&rdquo;
bid for the reputation of cleverness, from nobody&rsquo;s really having
any.&nbsp; It was agreeable to him at this very moment to be sure that
when he had answered, after a brief demur, &ldquo;Well, yes; so, precisely,
you may put it!&rdquo; her imagination would still do him justice.&nbsp;
He explained that even if never a dollar were to come to him from the
other house he would nevertheless cherish this one; and he dwelt, further,
while they lingered and wandered, on the fact of the stupefaction he
was already exciting, the positive mystification he felt himself create.</p>
<p>He spoke of the value of all he read into it, into the mere sight
of the walls, mere shapes of the rooms, mere sound of the floors, mere
feel, in his hand, of the old silver-plated knobs of the several mahogany
doors, which suggested the pressure of the palms of the dead the seventy
years of the past in fine that these things represented, the annals
of nearly three generations, counting his grandfather&rsquo;s, the one
that had ended there, and the impalpable ashes of his long-extinct youth,
afloat in the very air like microscopic motes.&nbsp; She listened to
everything; she was a woman who answered intimately but who utterly
didn&rsquo;t chatter.&nbsp; She scattered abroad therefore no cloud
of words; she could assent, she could agree, above all she could encourage,
without doing that.&nbsp; Only at the last she went a little further
than he had done himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then how do you know?&nbsp;
You may still, after all, want to live here.&rdquo;&nbsp; It rather
indeed pulled him up, for it wasn&rsquo;t what he had been thinking,
at least in her sense of the words, &ldquo;You mean I may decide to
stay on for the sake of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>with</i> such a home&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, quite
beautifully, she had too much tact to dot so monstrous an <i>i</i>,
and it was precisely an illustration of the way she didn&rsquo;t rattle.&nbsp;
How could any one&mdash;of any wit&mdash;insist on any one else&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wanting&rdquo; to live in New York?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I <i>might</i> have lived here
(since I had my opportunity early in life); I might have put in here
all these years.&nbsp; Then everything would have been different enough&mdash;and,
I dare say, &lsquo;funny&rsquo; enough.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s another
matter.&nbsp; And then the beauty of it&mdash;I mean of my perversity,
of my refusal to agree to a &lsquo;deal&rsquo;&mdash;is just in the
total absence of a reason.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see that if I had a
reason about the matter at all it would <i>have</i> to be the other
way, and would then be inevitably a reason of dollars?&nbsp; There are
no reasons here <i>but</i> of dollars.&nbsp; Let us therefore have none
whatever&mdash;not the ghost of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were back in the hall then for departure, but from where they
stood the vista was large, through an open door, into the great square
main saloon, with its almost antique felicity of brave spaces between
windows.&nbsp; Her eyes came back from that reach and met his own a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you very sure the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; of one
doesn&rsquo;t, much rather, serve&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a positive sense of turning pale.&nbsp; But it was as near
as they were then to come.&nbsp; For he made answer, he believed, between
a glare and a grin: &ldquo;Oh ghosts&mdash;of course the place must
swarm with them!&nbsp; I should be ashamed of it if it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Poor Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s right, and it&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t
asked her to do more than look in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Staverton&rsquo;s gaze again lost itself, and things she didn&rsquo;t
utter, it was clear, came and went in her mind.&nbsp; She might even
for the minute, off there in the fine room, have imagined some element
dimly gathering.&nbsp; Simplified like the death-mask of a handsome
face, it perhaps produced for her just then an effect akin to the stir
of an expression in the &ldquo;set&rdquo; commemorative plaster.&nbsp;
Yet whatever her impression may have been she produced instead a vague
platitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if it were only furnished and lived in&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared to imply that in case of its being still furnished he
might have been a little less opposed to the idea of a return.&nbsp;
But she passed straight into the vestibule, as if to leave her words
behind her, and the next moment he had opened the house-door and was
standing with her on the steps.&nbsp; He closed the door and, while
he re-pocketed his key, looking up and down, they took in the comparatively
harsh actuality of the Avenue, which reminded him of the assault of
the outer light of the Desert on the traveller emerging from an Egyptian
tomb.&nbsp; But he risked before they stepped into the street his gathered
answer to her speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;For me it <i>is</i> lived in.&nbsp;
For me it is furnished.&rdquo;&nbsp; At which it was easy for her to
sigh &ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo; all vaguely and discreetly; since his parents
and his favourite sister, to say nothing of other kin, in numbers, had
run their course and met their end there.&nbsp; That represented, within
the walls, ineffaceable life.</p>
<p>It was a few days after this that, during an hour passed with her
again, he had expressed his impatience of the too flattering curiosity&mdash;among
the people he met&mdash;about his appreciation of New York.&nbsp; He
had arrived at none at all that was socially producible, and as for
that matter of his &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; (thinking the better or the
worse of anything there) he was wholly taken up with one subject of
thought.&nbsp; It was mere vain egoism, and it was moreover, if she
liked, a morbid obsession.&nbsp; He found all things come back to the
question of what he personally might have been, how he might have led
his life and &ldquo;turned out,&rdquo; if he had not so, at the outset,
given it up.&nbsp; And confessing for the first time to the intensity
within him of this absurd speculation&mdash;which but proved also, no
doubt, the habit of too selfishly thinking&mdash;he affirmed the impotence
there of any other source of interest, any other native appeal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What would it have made of me, what would it have made of me?&nbsp;
I keep for ever wondering, all idiotically; as if I could possibly know!&nbsp;
I see what it has made of dozens of others, those I meet, and it positively
aches within me, to the point of exasperation, that it would have made
something of me as well.&nbsp; Only I can&rsquo;t make out what, and
the worry of it, the small rage of curiosity never to be satisfied,
brings back what I remember to have felt, once or twice, after judging
best, for reasons, to burn some important letter unopened.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been sorry, I&rsquo;ve hated it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never known what was
in the letter.&nbsp; You may, of course, say it&rsquo;s a trifle&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a trifle,&rdquo; Miss Staverton
gravely interrupted.</p>
<p>She was seated by her fire, and before her, on his feet and restless,
he turned to and fro between this intensity of his idea and a fitful
and unseeing inspection, through his single eye-glass, of the dear little
old objects on her chimney-piece.&nbsp; Her interruption made him for
an instant look at her harder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care if
you did!&rdquo; he laughed, however; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s only a figure,
at any rate, for the way I now feel.&nbsp; <i>Not</i> to have followed
my perverse young course&mdash;and almost in the teeth of my father&rsquo;s
curse, as I may say; not to have kept it up, so, &lsquo;over there,&rsquo;
from that day to this, without a doubt or a pang; not, above all, to
have liked it, to have loved it, so much, loved it, no doubt, with such
an abysmal conceit of my own preference; some variation from <i>that</i>,
I say, must have produced some different effect for my life and for
my &lsquo;form.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should have stuck here&mdash;if it had
been possible; and I was too young, at twenty-three, to judge, <i>pour
deux sous</i>, whether it <i>were</i> possible.&nbsp; If I had waited
I might have seen it was, and then I might have been, by staying here,
something nearer to one of these types who have been hammered so hard
and made so keen by their conditions.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that I admire
them so much&mdash;the question of any charm in them, or of any charm,
beyond that of the rank money-passion, exerted by their conditions <i>for</i>
them, has nothing to do with the matter: it&rsquo;s only a question
of what fantastic, yet perfectly possible, development of my own nature
I mayn&rsquo;t have missed.&nbsp; It comes over me that I had then a
strange <i>alter ego</i> deep down somewhere within me, as the full-blown
flower is in the small tight bud, and that I just took the course, I
just transferred him to the climate, that blighted him for once and
for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wonder about the flower,&rdquo; Miss Staverton said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So do I, if you want to know; and so I&rsquo;ve been wondering
these several weeks.&nbsp; I believe in the flower,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;I feel it would have been quite splendid, quite huge and monstrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monstrous above all!&rdquo; her visitor echoed; &ldquo;and
I imagine, by the same stroke, quite hideous and offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;if
you did you wouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d know, and that
would be enough for you.&nbsp; What you feel&mdash;and what I feel <i>for</i>
you&mdash;is that you&rsquo;d have had power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have liked me that way?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She barely hung fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;How should I not have liked you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have liked me, have preferred me,
a billionaire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I not have liked you?&rdquo; she simply again asked.</p>
<p>He stood before her still&mdash;her question kept him motionless.&nbsp;
He took it in, so much there was of it; and indeed his not otherwise
meeting it testified to that.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know at least what I am,&rdquo;
he simply went on; &ldquo;the other side of the medal&rsquo;s clear
enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not been edifying&mdash;I believe I&rsquo;m
thought in a hundred quarters to have been barely decent.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
followed strange paths and worshipped strange gods; it must have come
to you again and again&mdash;in fact you&rsquo;ve admitted to me as
much&mdash;that I was leading, at any time these thirty years, a selfish
frivolous scandalous life.&nbsp; And you see what it has made of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She just waited, smiling at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see what it has
made of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re a person whom nothing can have altered.&nbsp;
You were born to be what you are, anywhere, anyway: you&rsquo;ve the
perfection nothing else could have blighted.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t you
see how, without my exile, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been waiting till
now&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; But he pulled up for the strange pang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing to see,&rdquo; she presently said, &ldquo;seems
to me to be that it has spoiled nothing.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t spoiled
your being here at last.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t spoiled this.&nbsp; It
hasn&rsquo;t spoiled your speaking&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She also however
faltered.</p>
<p>He wondered at everything her controlled emotion might mean.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you believe then&mdash;too dreadfully!&mdash;that I <i>am</i>
as good as I might ever have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp; Far from it!&rdquo;&nbsp; With which she got
up from her chair and was nearer to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
care,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m good enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you believe it if I say
so?&nbsp; I mean will you let that settle your question for you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then as if making out in his face that he drew back from this, that
he had some idea which, however absurd, he couldn&rsquo;t yet bargain
away: &ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t care either&mdash;but very differently:
you don&rsquo;t care for anything but yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spencer Brydon recognised it&mdash;it was in fact what he had absolutely
professed.&nbsp; Yet he importantly qualified.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He</i>
isn&rsquo;t myself.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the just so totally other person.&nbsp;
But I do want to see him,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I can.&nbsp;
And I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their eyes met for a minute while he guessed from something in hers
that she divined his strange sense.&nbsp; But neither of them otherwise
expressed it, and her apparent understanding, with no protesting shock,
no easy derision, touched him more deeply than anything yet, constituting
for his stifled perversity, on the spot, an element that was like breatheable
air.&nbsp; What she said however was unexpected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
<i>I&rsquo;ve</i> seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him in a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh a &lsquo;dream&rsquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; It let him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But twice over,&rdquo; she continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw him
as I see you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dreamed the same dream&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice over,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did somehow a little speak to him, as it also gratified him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You dream about me at that rate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah about <i>him</i>!&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>His eyes again sounded her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you know all about
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she said nothing more: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the wretch like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, and it was as if he were pressing her so hard that,
resisting for reasons of her own, she had to turn away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you some other time!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>It was after this that there was most of a virtue for him, most of
a cultivated charm, most of a preposterous secret thrill, in the particular
form of surrender to his obsession and of address to what he more and
more believed to be his privilege.&nbsp; It was what in these weeks
he was living for&mdash;since he really felt life to begin but after
Mrs. Muldoon had retired from the scene and, visiting the ample house
from attic to cellar, making sure he was alone, he knew himself in safe
possession and, as he tacitly expressed it, let himself go.&nbsp; He
sometimes came twice in the twenty-four hours; the moments he liked
best were those of gathering dusk, of the short autumn twilight; this
was the time of which, again and again, he found himself hoping most.&nbsp;
Then he could, as seemed to him, most intimately wander and wait, linger
and listen, feel his fine attention, never in his life before so fine,
on the pulse of the great vague place: he preferred the lampless hour
and only wished he might have prolonged each day the deep crepuscular
spell.&nbsp; Later&mdash;rarely much before midnight, but then for a
considerable vigil&mdash;he watched with his glimmering light; moving
slowly, holding it high, playing it far, rejoicing above all, as much
as he might, in open vistas, reaches of communication between rooms
and by passages; the long straight chance or show, as he would have
called it, for the revelation he pretended to invite.&nbsp; It was a
practice he found he could perfectly &ldquo;work&rdquo; without exciting
remark; no one was in the least the wiser for it; even Alice Staverton,
who was moreover a well of discretion, didn&rsquo;t quite fully imagine.</p>
<p>He let himself in and let himself out with the assurance of calm
proprietorship; and accident so far favoured him that, if a fat Avenue
&ldquo;officer&rdquo; had happened on occasion to see him entering at
eleven-thirty, he had never yet, to the best of his belief, been noticed
as emerging at two.&nbsp; He walked there on the crisp November nights,
arrived regularly at the evening&rsquo;s end; it was as easy to do this
after dining out as to take his way to a club or to his hotel.&nbsp;
When he left his club, if he hadn&rsquo;t been dining out, it was ostensibly
to go to his hotel; and when he left his hotel, if he had spent a part
of the evening there, it was ostensibly to go to his club.&nbsp; Everything
was easy in fine; everything conspired and promoted: there was truly
even in the strain of his experience something that glossed over, something
that salved and simplified, all the rest of consciousness.&nbsp; He
circulated, talked, renewed, loosely and pleasantly, old relations&mdash;met
indeed, so far as he could, new expectations and seemed to make out
on the whole that in spite of the career, of such different contacts,
which he had spoken of to Miss Staverton as ministering so little, for
those who might have watched it, to edification, he was positively rather
liked than not.&nbsp; He was a dim secondary social success&mdash;and
all with people who had truly not an idea of him.&nbsp; It was all mere
surface sound, this murmur of their welcome, this popping of their corks&mdash;just
as his gestures of response were the extravagant shadows, emphatic in
proportion as they meant little, of some game of <i>ombres chinoises</i>.&nbsp;
He projected himself all day, in thought, straight over the bristling
line of hard unconscious heads and into the other, the real, the waiting
life; the life that, as soon as he had heard behind him the click of
his great house-door, began for him, on the jolly corner, as beguilingly
as the slow opening bars of some rich music follows the tap of the conductor&rsquo;s
wand.</p>
<p>He always caught the first effect of the steel point of his stick
on the old marble of the hall pavement, large black-and-white squares
that he remembered as the admiration of his childhood and that had then
made in him, as he now saw, for the growth of an early conception of
style.&nbsp; This effect was the dim reverberating tinkle as of some
far-off bell hung who should say where?&mdash;in the depths of the house,
of the past, of that mystical other world that might have flourished
for him had he not, for weal or woe, abandoned it.&nbsp; On this impression
he did ever the same thing; he put his stick noiselessly away in a corner&mdash;feeling
the place once more in the likeness of some great glass bowl, all precious
concave crystal, set delicately humming by the play of a moist finger
round its edge.&nbsp; The concave crystal held, as it were, this mystical
other world, and the indescribably fine murmur of its rim was the sigh
there, the scarce audible pathetic wail to his strained ear, of all
the old baffled forsworn possibilities.&nbsp; What he did therefore
by this appeal of his hushed presence was to wake them into such measure
of ghostly life as they might still enjoy.&nbsp; They were shy, all
but unappeasably shy, but they weren&rsquo;t really sinister; at least
they weren&rsquo;t as he had hitherto felt them&mdash;before they had
taken the Form he so yearned to make them take, the Form he at moments
saw himself in the light of fairly hunting on tiptoe, the points of
his evening shoes, from room to room and from storey to storey.</p>
<p>That was the essence of his vision&mdash;which was all rank folly,
if one would, while he was out of the house and otherwise occupied,
but which took on the last verisimilitude as soon as he was placed and
posted.&nbsp; He knew what he meant and what he wanted; it was as clear
as the figure on a cheque presented in demand for cash.&nbsp; His <i>alter
ego</i> &ldquo;walked&rdquo;&mdash;that was the note of his image of
him, while his image of his motive for his own odd pastime was the desire
to waylay him and meet him.&nbsp; He roamed, slowly, warily, but all
restlessly, he himself did&mdash;Mrs. Muldoon had been right, absolutely,
with her figure of their &ldquo;craping&rdquo;; and the presence he
watched for would roam restlessly too.&nbsp; But it would be as cautious
and as shifty; the conviction of its probable, in fact its already quite
sensible, quite audible evasion of pursuit grew for him from night to
night, laying on him finally a rigour to which nothing in his life had
been comparable.&nbsp; It had been the theory of many superficially-judging
persons, he knew, that he was wasting that life in a surrender to sensations,
but he had tasted of no pleasure so fine as his actual tension, had
been introduced to no sport that demanded at once the patience and the
nerve of this stalking of a creature more subtle, yet at bay perhaps
more formidable, than any beast of the forest.&nbsp; The terms, the
comparisons, the very practices of the chase positively came again into
play; there were even moments when passages of his occasional experience
as a sportsman, stirred memories, from his younger time, of moor and
mountain and desert, revived for him&mdash;and to the increase of his
keenness&mdash;by the tremendous force of analogy.&nbsp; He found himself
at moments&mdash;once he had placed his single light on some mantel-shelf
or in some recess&mdash;stepping back into shelter or shade, effacing
himself behind a door or in an embrasure, as he had sought of old the
vantage of rock and tree; he found himself holding his breath and living
in the joy of the instant, the supreme suspense created by big game
alone.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid (though putting himself the question as he
believed gentlemen on Bengal tiger-shoots or in close quarters with
the great bear of the Rockies had been known to confess to having put
it); and this indeed&mdash;since here at least he might be frank!&mdash;because
of the impression, so intimate and so strange, that he himself produced
as yet a dread, produced certainly a strain, beyond the liveliest he
was likely to feel.&nbsp; They fell for him into categories, they fairly
became familiar, the signs, for his own perception, of the alarm his
presence and his vigilance created; though leaving him always to remark,
portentously, on his probably having formed a relation, his probably
enjoying a consciousness, unique in the experience of man.&nbsp; People
enough, first and last, had been in terror of apparitions, but who had
ever before so turned the tables and become himself, in the apparitional
world, an incalculable terror?&nbsp; He might have found this sublime
had he quite dared to think of it; but he didn&rsquo;t too much insist,
truly, on that side of his privilege.&nbsp; With habit and repetition
he gained to an extraordinary degree the power to penetrate the dusk
of distances and the darkness of corners, to resolve back into their
innocence the treacheries of uncertain light, the evil-looking forms
taken in the gloom by mere shadows, by accidents of the air, by shifting
effects of perspective; putting down his dim luminary he could still
wander on without it, pass into other rooms and, only knowing it was
there behind him in case of need, see his way about, visually project
for his purpose a comparative clearness.&nbsp; It made him feel, this
acquired faculty, like some monstrous stealthy cat; he wondered if he
would have glared at these moments with large shining yellow eyes, and
what it mightn&rsquo;t verily be, for the poor hard-pressed <i>alter
ego</i>, to be confronted with such a type.</p>
<p>He liked however the open shutters; he opened everywhere those Mrs.
Muldoon had closed, closing them as carefully afterwards, so that she
shouldn&rsquo;t notice: he liked&mdash;oh this he did like, and above
all in the upper rooms!&mdash;the sense of the hard silver of the autumn
stars through the window-panes, and scarcely less the flare of the street-lamps
below, the white electric lustre which it would have taken curtains
to keep out.&nbsp; This was human actual social; this was of the world
he had lived in, and he was more at his ease certainly for the countenance,
coldly general and impersonal, that all the while and in spite of his
detachment it seemed to give him.&nbsp; He had support of course mostly
in the rooms at the wide front and the prolonged side; it failed him
considerably in the central shades and the parts at the back.&nbsp;
But if he sometimes, on his rounds, was glad of his optical reach, so
none the less often the rear of the house affected him as the very jungle
of his prey.&nbsp; The place was there more subdivided; a large &ldquo;extension&rdquo;
in particular, where small rooms for servants had been multiplied, abounded
in nooks and corners, in closets and passages, in the ramifications
especially of an ample back staircase over which he leaned, many a time,
to look far down&mdash;not deterred from his gravity even while aware
that he might, for a spectator, have figured some solemn simpleton playing
at hide-and-seek.&nbsp; Outside in fact he might himself make that ironic
<i>rapprochement</i>; but within the walls, and in spite of the clear
windows, his consistency was proof against the cynical light of New
York.</p>
<p>It had belonged to that idea of the exasperated consciousness of
his victim to become a real test for him; since he had quite put it
to himself from the first that, oh distinctly! he could &ldquo;cultivate&rdquo;
his whole perception.&nbsp; He had felt it as above all open to cultivation&mdash;which
indeed was but another name for his manner of spending his time.&nbsp;
He was bringing it on, bringing it to perfection, by practice; in consequence
of which it had grown so fine that he was now aware of impressions,
attestations of his general postulate, that couldn&rsquo;t have broken
upon him at once.&nbsp; This was the case more specifically with a phenomenon
at last quite frequent for him in the upper rooms, the recognition&mdash;absolutely
unmistakeable, and by a turn dating from a particular hour, his resumption
of his campaign after a diplomatic drop, a calculated absence of three
nights&mdash;of his being definitely followed, tracked at a distance
carefully taken and to the express end that he should the less confidently,
less arrogantly, appear to himself merely to pursue.&nbsp; It worried,
it finally quite broke him up, for it proved, of all the conceivable
impressions, the one least suited to his book.&nbsp; He was kept in
sight while remaining himself&mdash;as regards the essence of his position&mdash;sightless,
and his only recourse then was in abrupt turns, rapid recoveries of
ground.&nbsp; He wheeled about, retracing his steps, as if he might
so catch in his face at least the stirred air of some other quick revolution.&nbsp;
It was indeed true that his fully dislocalised thought of these manoeuvres
recalled to him Pantaloon, at the Christmas farce, buffeted and tricked
from behind by ubiquitous Harlequin; but it left intact the influence
of the conditions themselves each time he was re-exposed to them, so
that in fact this association, had he suffered it to become constant,
would on a certain side have but ministered to his intenser gravity.&nbsp;
He had made, as I have said, to create on the premises the baseless
sense of a reprieve, his three absences; and the result of the third
was to confirm the after-effect of the second.</p>
<p>On his return that night&mdash;the night succeeding his last intermission&mdash;he
stood in the hall and looked up the staircase with a certainty more
intimate than any he had yet known.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s <i>there</i>,
at the top, and waiting&mdash;not, as in general, falling back for disappearance.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s holding his ground, and it&rsquo;s the first time&mdash;which
is a proof, isn&rsquo;t it? that something has happened for him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So Brydon argued with his hand on the banister and his foot on the lowest
stair; in which position he felt as never before the air chilled by
his logic.&nbsp; He himself turned cold in it, for he seemed of a sudden
to know what now was involved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harder pressed?&mdash;yes,
he takes it in, with its thus making clear to him that I&rsquo;ve come,
as they say, &lsquo;to stay.&rsquo;&nbsp; He finally doesn&rsquo;t like
and can&rsquo;t bear it, in the sense, I mean, that his wrath, his menaced
interest, now balances with his dread.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve hunted him till
he has &lsquo;turned&rsquo;; that, up there, is what has happened&mdash;he&rsquo;s
the fanged or the antlered animal brought at last to bay.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There came to him, as I say&mdash;but determined by an influence beyond
my notation!&mdash;the acuteness of this certainty; under which however
the next moment he had broken into a sweat that he would as little have
consented to attribute to fear as he would have dared immediately to
act upon it for enterprise.&nbsp; It marked none the less a prodigious
thrill, a thrill that represented sudden dismay, no doubt, but also
represented, and with the selfsame throb, the strangest, the most joyous,
possibly the next minute almost the proudest, duplication of consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been dodging, retreating, hiding, but now, worked up
to anger, he&rsquo;ll fight!&rdquo;&mdash;this intense impression made
a single mouthful, as it were, of terror and applause.&nbsp; But what
was wondrous was that the applause, for the felt fact, was so eager,
since, if it was his other self he was running to earth, this ineffable
identity was thus in the last resort not unworthy of him.&nbsp; It bristled
there&mdash;somewhere near at hand, however unseen still&mdash;as the
hunted thing, even as the trodden worm of the adage must at last bristle;
and Brydon at this instant tasted probably of a sensation more complex
than had ever before found itself consistent with sanity.&nbsp; It was
as if it would have shamed him that a character so associated with his
own should triumphantly succeed in just skulking, should to the end
not risk the open; so that the drop of this danger was, on the spot,
a great lift of the whole situation.&nbsp; Yet with another rare shift
of the same subtlety he was already trying to measure by how much more
he himself might now be in peril of fear; so rejoicing that he could,
in another form, actively inspire that fear, and simultaneously quaking
for the form in which he might passively know it.</p>
<p>The apprehension of knowing it must after a little have grown in
him, and the strangest moment of his adventure perhaps, the most memorable
or really most interesting, afterwards, of his crisis, was the lapse
of certain instants of concentrated conscious <i>combat</i>, the sense
of a need to hold on to something, even after the manner of a man slipping
and slipping on some awful incline; the vivid impulse, above all, to
move, to act, to charge, somehow and upon something&mdash;to show himself,
in a word, that he wasn&rsquo;t afraid.&nbsp; The state of &ldquo;holding
on&rdquo; was thus the state to which he was momentarily reduced; if
there had been anything, in the great vacancy, to seize, he would presently
have been aware of having clutched it as he might under a shock at home
have clutched the nearest chair-back.&nbsp; He had been surprised at
any rate&mdash;of this he <i>was</i> aware&mdash;into something unprecedented
since his original appropriation of the place; he had closed his eyes,
held them tight, for a long minute, as with that instinct of dismay
and that terror of vision.&nbsp; When he opened them the room, the other
contiguous rooms, extraordinarily, seemed lighter&mdash;so light, almost,
that at first he took the change for day.&nbsp; He stood firm, however
that might be, just where he had paused; his resistance had helped him&mdash;it
was as if there were something he had tided over.&nbsp; He knew after
a little what this was&mdash;it had been in the imminent danger of flight.&nbsp;
He had stiffened his will against going; without this he would have
made for the stairs, and it seemed to him that, still with his eyes
closed, he would have descended them, would have known how, straight
and swiftly, to the bottom.</p>
<p>Well, as he had held out, here he was&mdash;still at the top, among
the more intricate upper rooms and with the gauntlet of the others,
of all the rest of the house, still to run when it should be his time
to go.&nbsp; He would go at his time&mdash;only at his time: didn&rsquo;t
he go every night very much at the same hour?&nbsp; He took out his
watch&mdash;there was light for that: it was scarcely a quarter past
one, and he had never withdrawn so soon.&nbsp; He reached his lodgings
for the most part at two&mdash;with his walk of a quarter of an hour.&nbsp;
He would wait for the last quarter&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t stir till
then; and he kept his watch there with his eyes on it, reflecting while
he held it that this deliberate wait, a wait with an effort, which he
recognised, would serve perfectly for the attestation he desired to
make.&nbsp; It would prove his courage&mdash;unless indeed the latter
might most be proved by his budging at last from his place.&nbsp; What
he mainly felt now was that, since he hadn&rsquo;t originally scuttled,
he had his dignities&mdash;which had never in his life seemed so many&mdash;all
to preserve and to carry aloft.&nbsp; This was before him in truth as
a physical image, an image almost worthy of an age of greater romance.&nbsp;
That remark indeed glimmered for him only to glow the next instant with
a finer light; since what age of romance, after all, could have matched
either the state of his mind or, &ldquo;objectively,&rdquo; as they
said, the wonder of his situation?&nbsp; The only difference would have
been that, brandishing his dignities over his head as in a parchment
scroll, he might then&mdash;that is in the heroic time&mdash;have proceeded
downstairs with a drawn sword in his other grasp.</p>
<p>At present, really, the light he had set down on the mantel of the
next room would have to figure his sword; which utensil, in the course
of a minute, he had taken the requisite number of steps to possess himself
of.&nbsp; The door between the rooms was open, and from the second another
door opened to a third.&nbsp; These rooms, as he remembered, gave all
three upon a common corridor as well, but there was a fourth, beyond
them, without issue save through the preceding.&nbsp; To have moved,
to have heard his step again, was appreciably a help; though even in
recognising this he lingered once more a little by the chimney-piece
on which his light had rested.&nbsp; When he next moved, just hesitating
where to turn, he found himself considering a circumstance that, after
his first and comparatively vague apprehension of it, produced in him
the start that often attends some pang of recollection, the violent
shock of having ceased happily to forget.&nbsp; He had come into sight
of the door in which the brief chain of communication ended and which
he now surveyed from the nearer threshold, the one not directly facing
it.&nbsp; Placed at some distance to the left of this point, it would
have admitted him to the last room of the four, the room without other
approach or egress, had it not, to his intimate conviction, been closed
<i>since</i> his former visitation, the matter probably of a quarter
of an hour before.&nbsp; He stared with all his eyes at the wonder of
the fact, arrested again where he stood and again holding his breath
while he sounded his sense.&nbsp; Surely it had been <i>subsequently</i>
closed&mdash;that is it had been on his previous passage indubitably
open!</p>
<p>He took it full in the face that something had happened between&mdash;that
he couldn&rsquo;t have noticed before (by which he meant on his original
tour of all the rooms that evening) that such a barrier had exceptionally
presented itself.&nbsp; He had indeed since that moment undergone an
agitation so extraordinary that it might have muddled for him any earlier
view; and he tried to convince himself that he might perhaps then have
gone into the room and, inadvertently, automatically, on coming out,
have drawn the door after him.&nbsp; The difficulty was that this exactly
was what he never did; it was against his whole policy, as he might
have said, the essence of which was to keep vistas clear.&nbsp; He had
them from the first, as he was well aware, quite on the brain: the strange
apparition, at the far end of one of them, of his baffled &ldquo;prey&rdquo;
(which had become by so sharp an irony so little the term now to apply!)
was the form of success his imagination had most cherished, projecting
into it always a refinement of beauty.&nbsp; He had known fifty times
the start of perception that had afterwards dropped; had fifty times
gasped to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&rdquo; under some fond brief
hallucination.&nbsp; The house, as the case stood, admirably lent itself;
he might wonder at the taste, the native architecture of the particular
time, which could rejoice so in the multiplication of doors&mdash;the
opposite extreme to the modern, the actual almost complete proscription
of them; but it had fairly contributed to provoke this obsession of
the presence encountered telescopically, as he might say, focused and
studied in diminishing perspective and as by a rest for the elbow.</p>
<p>It was with these considerations that his present attention was charged&mdash;they
perfectly availed to make what he saw portentous.&nbsp; He <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>,
by any lapse, have blocked that aperture; and if he hadn&rsquo;t, if
it was unthinkable, why what else was clear but that there had been
another agent?&nbsp; Another agent?&mdash;he had been catching, as he
felt, a moment back, the very breath of him; but when had he been so
close as in this simple, this logical, this completely personal act?&nbsp;
It was so logical, that is, that one might have <i>taken</i> it for
personal; yet for what did Brydon take it, he asked himself, while,
softly panting, he felt his eyes almost leave their sockets.&nbsp; Ah
this time at last they <i>were</i>, the two, the opposed projections
of him, in presence; and this time, as much as one would, the question
of danger loomed.&nbsp; With it rose, as not before, the question of
courage&mdash;for what he knew the blank face of the door to say to
him was &ldquo;Show us how much you have!&rdquo;&nbsp; It stared, it
glared back at him with that challenge; it put to him the two alternatives:
should he just push it open or not?&nbsp; Oh to have this consciousness
was to <i>think</i>&mdash;and to think, Brydon knew, as he stood there,
was, with the lapsing moments, not to have acted!&nbsp; Not to have
acted&mdash;that was the misery and the pang&mdash;was even still not
to act; was in fact <i>all</i> to feel the thing in another, in a new
and terrible way.&nbsp; How long did he pause and how long did he debate?&nbsp;
There was presently nothing to measure it; for his vibration had already
changed&mdash;as just by the effect of its intensity.&nbsp; Shut up
there, at bay, defiant, and with the prodigy of the thing palpably proveably
<i>done</i>, thus giving notice like some stark signboard&mdash;under
that accession of accent the situation itself had turned; and Brydon
at last remarkably made up his mind on what it had turned to.</p>
<p>It had turned altogether to a different admonition; to a supreme
hint, for him, of the value of Discretion!&nbsp; This slowly dawned,
no doubt&mdash;for it could take its time; so perfectly, on his threshold,
had he been stayed, so little as yet had he either advanced or retreated.&nbsp;
It was the strangest of all things that now when, by his taking ten
steps and applying his hand to a latch, or even his shoulder and his
knee, if necessary, to a panel, all the hunger of his prime need might
have been met, his high curiosity crowned, his unrest assuaged&mdash;it
was amazing, but it was also exquisite and rare, that insistence should
have, at a touch, quite dropped from him.&nbsp; Discretion&mdash;he
jumped at that; and yet not, verily, at such a pitch, because it saved
his nerves or his skin, but because, much more valuably, it saved the
situation.&nbsp; When I say he &ldquo;jumped&rdquo; at it I feel the
consonance of this term with the fact that&mdash;at the end indeed of
I know not how long&mdash;he did move again, he crossed straight to
the door.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t touch it&mdash;it seemed now that
he might if he would: he would only just wait there a little, to show,
to prove, that he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He had thus another station,
close to the thin partition by which revelation was denied him; but
with his eyes bent and his hands held off in a mere intensity of stillness.&nbsp;
He listened as if there had been something to hear, but this attitude,
while it lasted, was his own communication.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t
then&mdash;good: I spare you and I give up.&nbsp; You affect me as by
the appeal positively for pity: you convince me that for reasons rigid
and sublime&mdash;what do I know?&mdash;we both of us should have suffered.&nbsp;
I respect them then, and, though moved and privileged as, I believe,
it has never been given to man, I retire, I renounce&mdash;never, on
my honour, to try again.&nbsp; So rest for ever&mdash;and let <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, for Brydon, was the deep sense of this last demonstration&mdash;solemn,
measured, directed, as he felt it to be.&nbsp; He brought it to a close,
he turned away; and now verily he knew how deeply he had been stirred.&nbsp;
He retraced his steps, taking up his candle, burnt, he observed, well-nigh
to the socket, and marking again, lighten it as he would, the distinctness
of his footfall; after which, in a moment, he knew himself at the other
side of the house.&nbsp; He did here what he had not yet done at these
hours&mdash;he opened half a casement, one of those in the front, and
let in the air of the night; a thing he would have taken at any time
previous for a sharp rupture of his spell.&nbsp; His spell was broken
now, and it didn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;broken by his concession and his
surrender, which made it idle henceforth that he should ever come back.&nbsp;
The empty street&mdash;its other life so marked even by great lamp-lit
vacancy&mdash;was within call, within touch; he stayed there as to be
in it again, high above it though he was still perched; he watched as
for some comforting common fact, some vulgar human note, the passage
of a scavenger or a thief, some night-bird however base.&nbsp; He would
have blessed that sign of life; he would have welcomed positively the
slow approach of his friend the policeman, whom he had hitherto only
sought to avoid, and was not sure that if the patrol had come into sight
he mightn&rsquo;t have felt the impulse to get into relation with it,
to hail it, on some pretext, from his fourth floor.</p>
<p>The pretext that wouldn&rsquo;t have been too silly or too compromising,
the explanation that would have saved his dignity and kept his name,
in such a case, out of the papers, was not definite to him: he was so
occupied with the thought of recording his Discretion&mdash;as an effect
of the vow he had just uttered to his intimate adversary&mdash;that
the importance of this loomed large and something had overtaken all
ironically his sense of proportion.&nbsp; If there had been a ladder
applied to the front of the house, even one of the vertiginous perpendiculars
employed by painters and roofers and sometimes left standing overnight,
he would have managed somehow, astride of the window-sill, to compass
by outstretched leg and arm that mode of descent.&nbsp; If there had
been some such uncanny thing as he had found in his room at hotels,
a workable fire-escape in the form of notched cable or a canvas shoot,
he would have availed himself of it as a proof&mdash;well, of his present
delicacy.&nbsp; He nursed that sentiment, as the question stood, a little
in vain, and even&mdash;at the end of he scarce knew, once more, how
long&mdash;found it, as by the action on his mind of the failure of
response of the outer world, sinking back to vague anguish.&nbsp; It
seemed to him he had waited an age for some stir of the great grim hush;
the life of the town was itself under a spell&mdash;so unnaturally,
up and down the whole prospect of known and rather ugly objects, the
blankness and the silence lasted.&nbsp; Had they ever, he asked himself,
the hard-faced houses, which had begun to look livid in the dim dawn,
had they ever spoken so little to any need of his spirit?&nbsp; Great
builded voids, great crowded stillnesses put on, often, in the heart
of cities, for the small hours, a sort of sinister mask, and it was
of this large collective negation that Brydon presently became conscious&mdash;all
the more that the break of day was, almost incredibly, now at hand,
proving to him what a night he had made of it.</p>
<p>He looked again at his watch, saw what had become of his time-values
(he had taken hours for minutes&mdash;not, as in other tense situations,
minutes for hours) and the strange air of the streets was but the weak,
the sullen flush of a dawn in which everything was still locked up.&nbsp;
His choked appeal from his own open window had been the sole note of
life, and he could but break off at last as for a worse despair.&nbsp;
Yet while so deeply demoralised he was capable again of an impulse denoting&mdash;at
least by his present measure&mdash;extraordinary resolution; of retracing
his steps to the spot where he had turned cold with the extinction of
his last pulse of doubt as to there being in the place another presence
than his own.&nbsp; This required an effort strong enough to sicken
him; but he had his reason, which over-mastered for the moment everything
else.&nbsp; There was the whole of the rest of the house to traverse,
and how should he screw himself to that if the door he had seen closed
were at present open?&nbsp; He could hold to the idea that the closing
had practically been for him an act of mercy, a chance offered him to
descend, depart, get off the ground and never again profane it.&nbsp;
This conception held together, it worked; but what it meant for him
depended now clearly on the amount of forbearance his recent action,
or rather his recent inaction, had engendered.&nbsp; The image of the
&ldquo;presence&rdquo; whatever it was, waiting there for him to go&mdash;this
image had not yet been so concrete for his nerves as when he stopped
short of the point at which certainty would have come to him.&nbsp;
For, with all his resolution, or more exactly with all his dread, he
did stop short&mdash;he hung back from really seeing.&nbsp; The risk
was too great and his fear too definite: it took at this moment an awful
specific form.</p>
<p>He knew&mdash;yes, as he had never known anything&mdash;that, <i>should</i>
he see the door open, it would all too abjectly be the end of him.&nbsp;
It would mean that the agent of his shame&mdash;for his shame was the
deep abjection&mdash;was once more at large and in general possession;
and what glared him thus in the face was the act that this would determine
for him.&nbsp; It would send him straight about to the window he had
left open, and by that window, be long ladder and dangling rope as absent
as they would, he saw himself uncontrollably insanely fatally take his
way to the street.&nbsp; The hideous chance of this he at least could
avert; but he could only avert it by recoiling in time from assurance.&nbsp;
He had the whole house to deal with, this fact was still there; only
he now knew that uncertainty alone could start him.&nbsp; He stole back
from where he had checked himself&mdash;merely to do so was suddenly
like safety&mdash;and, making blindly for the greater staircase, left
gaping rooms and sounding passages behind.&nbsp; Here was the top of
the stairs, with a fine large dim descent and three spacious landings
to mark off.&nbsp; His instinct was all for mildness, but his feet were
harsh on the floors, and, strangely, when he had in a couple of minutes
become aware of this, it counted somehow for help.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
have spoken, the tone of his voice would have scared him, and the common
conceit or resource of &ldquo;whistling in the dark&rdquo; (whether
literally or figuratively) have appeared basely vulgar; yet he liked
none the less to hear himself go, and when he had reached his first
landing&mdash;taking it all with no rush, but quite steadily&mdash;that
stage of success drew from him a gasp of relief.</p>
<p>The house, withal, seemed immense, the scale of space again inordinate;
the open rooms, to no one of which his eyes deflected, gloomed in their
shuttered state like mouths of caverns; only the high skylight that
formed the crown of the deep well created for him a medium in which
he could advance, but which might have been, for queerness of colour,
some watery under-world.&nbsp; He tried to think of something noble,
as that his property was really grand, a splendid possession; but this
nobleness took the form too of the clear delight with which he was finally
to sacrifice it.&nbsp; They might come in now, the builders, the destroyers&mdash;they
might come as soon as they would.&nbsp; At the end of two flights he
had dropped to another zone, and from the middle of the third, with
only one more left, he recognised the influence of the lower windows,
of half-drawn blinds, of the occasional gleam of street-lamps, of the
glazed spaces of the vestibule.&nbsp; This was the bottom of the sea,
which showed an illumination of its own and which he even saw paved&mdash;when
at a given moment he drew up to sink a long look over the banisters&mdash;with
the marble squares of his childhood.&nbsp; By that time indubitably
he felt, as he might have said in a commoner cause, better; it had allowed
him to stop and draw breath, and the case increased with the sight of
the old black-and-white slabs.&nbsp; But what he most felt was that
now surely, with the element of impunity pulling him as by hard firm
hands, the case was settled for what he might have seen above had he
dared that last look.&nbsp; The closed door, blessedly remote now, was
still closed&mdash;and he had only in short to reach that of the house.</p>
<p>He came down further, he crossed the passage forming the access to
the last flight and if here again he stopped an instant it was almost
for the sharpness of the thrill of assured escape.&nbsp; It made him
shut his eyes&mdash;which opened again to the straight slope of the
remainder of the stairs.&nbsp; Here was impunity still, but impunity
almost excessive; inasmuch as the side-lights and the high fantracery
of the entrance were glimmering straight into the hall; an appearance
produced, he the next instant saw, by the fact that the vestibule gaped
wide, that the hinged halves of the inner door had been thrown far back.&nbsp;
Out of that again the <i>question</i> sprang at him, making his eyes,
as he felt, half-start from his head, as they had done, at the top of
the house, before the sign of the other door.&nbsp; If he had left that
one open, hadn&rsquo;t he left this one closed, and wasn&rsquo;t he
now in <i>most</i> immediate presence of some inconceivable occult activity?&nbsp;
It was as sharp, the question, as a knife in his side, but the answer
hung fire still and seemed to lose itself in the vague darkness to which
the thin admitted dawn, glimmering archwise over the whole outer door,
made a semicircular margin, a cold silvery nimbus that seemed to play
a little as he looked&mdash;to shift and expand and contract.</p>
<p>It was as if there had been something within it, protected by indistinctness
and corresponding in extent with the opaque surface behind, the painted
panels of the last barrier to his escape, of which the key was in his
pocket.&nbsp; The indistinctness mocked him even while he stared, affected
him as somehow shrouding or challenging certitude, so that after faltering
an instant on his step he let himself go with the sense that here <i>was</i>
at last something to meet, to touch, to take, to know&mdash;something
all unnatural and dreadful, but to advance upon which was the condition
for him either of liberation or of supreme defeat.&nbsp; The penumbra,
dense and dark, was the virtual screen of a figure which stood in it
as still as some image erect in a niche or as some black-vizored sentinel
guarding a treasure.&nbsp; Brydon was to know afterwards, was to recall
and make out, the particular thing he had believed during the rest of
his descent.&nbsp; He saw, in its great grey glimmering margin, the
central vagueness diminish, and he felt it to be taking the very form
toward which, for so many days, the passion of his curiosity had yearned.&nbsp;
It gloomed, it loomed, it was something, it was somebody, the prodigy
of a personal presence.</p>
<p>Rigid and conscious, spectral yet human, a man of his own substance
and stature waited there to measure himself with his power to dismay.&nbsp;
This only could it be&mdash;this only till he recognised, with his advance,
that what made the face dim was the pair of raised hands that covered
it and in which, so far from being offered in defiance, it was buried,
as for dark deprecation.&nbsp; So Brydon, before him, took him in; with
every fact of him now, in the higher light, hard and acute&mdash;his
planted stillness, his vivid truth, his grizzled bent head and white
masking hands, his queer actuality of evening-dress, of dangling double
eye-glass, of gleaming silk lappet and white linen, of pearl button
and gold watch-guard and polished shoe.&nbsp; No portrait by a great
modern master could have presented him with more intensity, thrust him
out of his frame with more art, as if there had been &ldquo;treatment,&rdquo;
of the consummate sort, in his every shade and salience.&nbsp; The revulsion,
for our friend, had become, before he knew it, immense&mdash;this drop,
in the act of apprehension, to the sense of his adversary&rsquo;s inscrutable
manoeuvre.&nbsp; That meaning at least, while he gaped, it offered him;
for he could but gape at his other self in this other anguish, gape
as a proof that <i>he</i>, standing there for the achieved, the enjoyed,
the triumphant life, couldn&rsquo;t be faced in his triumph.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
the proof in the splendid covering hands, strong and completely spread?&mdash;so
spread and so intentional that, in spite of a special verity that surpassed
every other, the fact that one of these hands had lost two fingers,
which were reduced to stumps, as if accidentally shot away, the face
was effectually guarded and saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved,&rdquo; though, <i>would</i> it be?&mdash;Brydon breathed
his wonder till the very impunity of his attitude and the very insistence
of his eyes produced, as he felt, a sudden stir which showed the next
instant as a deeper portent, while the head raised itself, the betrayal
of a braver purpose.&nbsp; The hands, as he looked, began to move, to
open; then, as if deciding in a flash, dropped from the face and left
it uncovered and presented.&nbsp; Horror, with the sight, had leaped
into Brydon&rsquo;s throat, gasping there in a sound he couldn&rsquo;t
utter; for the bared identity was too hideous as <i>his</i>, and his
glare was the passion of his protest.&nbsp; The face, <i>that</i> face,
Spencer Brydon&rsquo;s?&mdash;he searched it still, but looking away
from it in dismay and denial, falling straight from his height of sublimity.&nbsp;
It was unknown, inconceivable, awful, disconnected from any possibility!&mdash;He
had been &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; he inwardly moaned, stalking such game
as this: the presence before him was a presence, the horror within him
a horror, but the waste of his nights had been only grotesque and the
success of his adventure an irony.&nbsp; Such an identity fitted his
at <i>no</i> point, made its alternative monstrous.&nbsp; A thousand
times yes, as it came upon him nearer now, the face was the face of
a stranger.&nbsp; It came upon him nearer now, quite as one of those
expanding fantastic images projected by the magic lantern of childhood;
for the stranger, whoever he might be, evil, odious, blatant, vulgar,
had advanced as for aggression, and he knew himself give ground.&nbsp;
Then harder pressed still, sick with the force of his shock, and falling
back as under the hot breath and the roused passion of a life larger
than his own, a rage of personality before which his own collapsed,
he felt the whole vision turn to darkness and his very feet give way.&nbsp;
His head went round; he was going; he had gone.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>What had next brought him back, clearly&mdash;though after how long?&mdash;was
Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s voice, coming to him from quite near, from so near
that he seemed presently to see her as kneeling on the ground before
him while he lay looking up at her; himself not wholly on the ground,
but half-raised and upheld&mdash;conscious, yes, of tenderness of support
and, more particularly, of a head pillowed in extraordinary softness
and faintly refreshing fragrance.&nbsp; He considered, he wondered,
his wit but half at his service; then another face intervened, bending
more directly over him, and he finally knew that Alice Staverton had
made her lap an ample and perfect cushion to him, and that she had to
this end seated herself on the lowest degree of the staircase, the rest
of his long person remaining stretched on his old black-and-white slabs.&nbsp;
They were cold, these marble squares of his youth; but <i>he</i> somehow
was not, in this rich return of consciousness&mdash;the most wonderful
hour, little by little, that he had ever known, leaving him, as it did,
so gratefully, so abysmally passive, and yet as with a treasure of intelligence
waiting all round him for quiet appropriation; dissolved, he might call
it, in the air of the place and producing the golden glow of a late
autumn afternoon.&nbsp; He had come back, yes&mdash;come back from further
away than any man but himself had ever travelled; but it was strange
how with this sense what he had come back <i>to</i> seemed really the
great thing, and as if his prodigious journey had been all for the sake
of it.&nbsp; Slowly but surely his consciousness grew, his vision of
his state thus completing itself; he had been miraculously <i>carried</i>
back&mdash;lifted and carefully borne as from where he had been picked
up, the uttermost end of an interminable grey passage.&nbsp; Even with
this he was suffered to rest, and what had now brought him to knowledge
was the break in the long mild motion.</p>
<p>It had brought him to knowledge, to knowledge&mdash;yes, this was
the beauty of his state; which came to resemble more and more that of
a man who has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance, and
then, after dreaming it away, after profaning it with matters strange
to it, has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie
and watch it grow.&nbsp; This was the drift of his patience&mdash;that
he had only to let it shine on him.&nbsp; He must moreover, with intermissions,
still have been lifted and borne; since why and how else should he have
known himself, later on, with the afternoon glow intenser, no longer
at the foot of his stairs&mdash;situated as these now seemed at that
dark other end of his tunnel&mdash;but on a deep window-bench of his
high saloon, over which had been spread, couch-fashion, a mantle of
soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that
one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth.&nbsp;
Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s face had gone, but the other, the second he had
recognised, hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped
and pillowed.&nbsp; He took it all in, and the more he took it the more
it seemed to suffice: he was as much at peace as if he had had food
and drink.&nbsp; It was the two women who had found him, on Mrs. Muldoon&rsquo;s
having plied, at her usual hour, her latch-key&mdash;and on her having
above all arrived while Miss Staverton still lingered near the house.&nbsp;
She had been turning away, all anxiety, from worrying the vain bell-handle&mdash;her
calculation having been of the hour of the good woman&rsquo;s visit;
but the latter, blessedly, had come up while she was still there, and
they had entered together.&nbsp; He had then lain, beyond the vestibule,
very much as he was lying now&mdash;quite, that is, as he appeared to
have fallen, but all so wondrously without bruise or gash; only in a
depth of stupor.&nbsp; What he most took in, however, at present, with
the steadier clearance, was that Alice Staverton had for a long unspeakable
moment not doubted he was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been that I <i>was</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made
it out as she held him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I can only have died.&nbsp;
You brought me literally to life.&nbsp; Only,&rdquo; he wondered, his
eyes rising to her, &ldquo;only, in the name of all the benedictions,
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took her but an instant to bend her face and kiss him, and something
in the manner of it, and in the way her hands clasped and locked his
head while he felt the cool charity and virtue of her lips, something
in all this beatitude somehow answered everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I keep you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh keep me, keep me!&rdquo; he pleaded while her face still
hung over him: in response to which it dropped again and stayed close,
clingingly close.&nbsp; It was the seal of their situation&mdash;of
which he tasted the impress for a long blissful moment in silence.&nbsp;
But he came back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet how did you know&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was uneasy.&nbsp; You were to have come, you remember&mdash;and
you had sent no word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember&mdash;I was to have gone to you at one to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It caught on to their &ldquo;old&rdquo; life and relation&mdash;which
were so near and so far.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was still out there in my strange
darkness&mdash;where was it, what was it?&nbsp; I must have stayed there
so long.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could but wonder at the depth and the duration
of his swoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since last night?&rdquo; she asked with a shade of fear for
her possible indiscretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this morning&mdash;it must have been: the cold dim dawn
of to-day.&nbsp; Where have I been,&rdquo; he vaguely wailed, &ldquo;where
have I been?&rdquo;&nbsp; He felt her hold him close, and it was as
if this helped him now to make in all security his mild moan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a long dark day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All in her tenderness she had waited a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
cold dim dawn?&rdquo; she quavered.</p>
<p>But he had already gone on piecing together the parts of the whole
prodigy.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I didn&rsquo;t turn up you came straight&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She barely cast about.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went first to your hotel&mdash;where
they told me of your absence.&nbsp; You had dined out last evening and
hadn&rsquo;t been back since.&nbsp; But they appeared to know you had
been at your club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you had the idea of <i>this</i>&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; she asked in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;of what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed at least you&rsquo;d have been here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
known, all along,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve been coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Known&rsquo; it&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve believed it.&nbsp; I said nothing to you
after that talk we had a month ago&mdash;but I felt sure.&nbsp; I knew
you <i>would</i>,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;d persist, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;d see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Brydon with his long wail.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody&mdash;an awful beast; whom I brought,
too horribly, to bay.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she bent over him again, and her eyes were in his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s not you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was as if, while
her face hovered, he might have made out in it, hadn&rsquo;t it been
so near, some particular meaning blurred by a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
thank heaven,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not you!&nbsp;
Of course it wasn&rsquo;t to have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but it <i>was</i>,&rdquo; he gently insisted.&nbsp; And
he stared before him now as he had been staring for so many weeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was to have known myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she returned consolingly.&nbsp;
And then reverting, and as if to account further for what she had herself
done, &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t only <i>that</i>, that you hadn&rsquo;t
been at home,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I waited till the hour
at which we had found Mrs. Muldoon that day of my going with you; and
she arrived, as I&rsquo;ve told you, while, failing to bring any one
to the door, I lingered in my despair on the steps.&nbsp; After a little,
if she hadn&rsquo;t come, by such a mercy, I should have found means
to hunt her up.&nbsp; But it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Alice Staverton,
as if once more with her fine intentions&mdash;&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
only that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes, as he lay, turned back to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What more then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met it, the wonder she had stirred.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the cold
dim dawn, you say?&nbsp; Well, in the cold dim dawn of this morning
I too saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw <i>me</i>&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw <i>him</i>,&rdquo; said Alice Staverton.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
must have been at the same moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay an instant taking it in&mdash;as if he wished to be quite
reasonable.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the same moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in my dream again, the same one I&rsquo;ve named
to you.&nbsp; He came back to me.&nbsp; Then I knew it for a sign.&nbsp;
He had come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Brydon raised himself; he had to see her better.&nbsp; She
helped him when she understood his movement, and he sat up, steadying
himself beside her there on the window-bench and with his right hand
grasping her left.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came to yourself,&rdquo; she beautifully smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;ve come to myself now&mdash;thanks to you, dearest.&nbsp;
But this brute, with his awful face&mdash;this brute&rsquo;s a black
stranger.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s none of <i>me</i>, even as I <i>might</i>
have been,&rdquo; Brydon sturdily declared.</p>
<p>But she kept the clearness that was like the breath of infallibility.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the whole point that you&rsquo;d have been different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He almost scowled for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;As different as <i>that</i>&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her look again was more beautiful to him than the things of this
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you exactly wanted to know <i>how</i>
different?&nbsp; So this morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you appeared
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you know it was I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, as I told you weeks ago, my mind, my imagination,
has worked so over what you might, what you mightn&rsquo;t have been&mdash;to
show you, you see, how I&rsquo;ve thought of you.&nbsp; In the midst
of that you came to me&mdash;that my wonder might be answered.&nbsp;
So I knew,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;and believed that, since the question
held you too so fast, as you told me that day, you too would see for
yourself.&nbsp; And when this morning I again saw I knew it would be
because you had&mdash;and also then, from the first moment, because
you somehow wanted me.&nbsp; <i>He</i> seemed to tell me of that.&nbsp;
So why,&rdquo; she strangely smiled, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t I like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It brought Spencer Brydon to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You &lsquo;like&rsquo;
that horror&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>could</i> have liked him.&nbsp; And to me,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;he was no horror.&nbsp; I had accepted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Accepted&rsquo;&mdash;?&rdquo; Brydon oddly sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before, for the interest of his difference&mdash;yes.&nbsp;
And as <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t disown him, as <i>I</i> knew him&mdash;which
you at last, confronted with him in his difference, so cruelly didn&rsquo;t,
my dear,&mdash;well, he must have been, you see, less dreadful to me.&nbsp;
And it may have pleased him that I pitied him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was beside him on her feet, but still holding his hand&mdash;still
with her arm supporting him.&nbsp; But though it all brought for him
thus a dim light, &ldquo;You &lsquo;pitied&rsquo; him?&rdquo; he grudgingly,
resentfully asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been unhappy, he has been ravaged,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t I been unhappy?&nbsp; Am not I&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
only to look at me!&mdash;ravaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I don&rsquo;t say I like him <i>better</i>,&rdquo; she
granted after a thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s grim, he&rsquo;s
worn&mdash;and things have happened to him.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t make
shift, for sight, with your charming monocle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;it struck Brydon; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
have sported mine &lsquo;down-town.&rsquo;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have guyed
me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His great convex pince-nez&mdash;I saw it, I recognised the
kind&mdash;is for his poor ruined sight.&nbsp; And his poor right hand&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Brydon winced&mdash;whether for his proved identity
or for his lost fingers.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;He has a million a year,&rdquo;
he lucidly added.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he isn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, he isn&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo;
she murmured, as he drew her to his breast.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
